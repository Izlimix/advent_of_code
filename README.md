Some attempts at solving Advent of Code challenges.
https://adventofcode.com/
No guarantee that any solutions are good, advice appreciated.

Note: Many of these answers won't scale well or work on every possible input (e.g. 2022 day 4), 
but they're enough to solve the exact input the puzzle gives. 
As https://blog.vero.site/post/advent-leaderboard mentions, a unique part of the Advent of Code 
is that it doesn't expect a program the handles the fully general problem, it gives only a single test case to handle.

(That said, advice on better-scaling approaches is always appreciated!)
